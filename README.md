# This project is a Work in Progress.

## The team is working on a automated license plate recognition (ALPR) system utilizing machine learning.

Our current design will include:
- Efficient and fast machine learning models which can read license plate strings
- Confidence gating system to flag possible wrong predictions
- Generalized scripts and in-depth user manuals on how to use the system
